            , I wanted to understand how it works and replicate it. My
            motivation for making the project was to learn new things, both in
            programming and in general knowledge. I wanted to learn new
            technologies and tools that I hadn't used before in software
            development. I wanted to use the existing knowledge about search
            engines and change things that I consider appropriate. I wanted my
            final system to have potential customers use it. In addition, I
            wanted to build a large system in dimensions that I hadn't built
            before.

            At the beginning of the project, I started researching with the help
            of the Internet and books about all kinds of project-related topics.
            I researched how search engines work, what types of search engines
            exist, how they differ from each other, what{" "}

            are as we relate to this topic, and similar questions that helped me
            better understand the topic on which I am preparing the project. I
            read several books and articles that helped me understand these
            issues, with an emphasis on "Christopher D. Manning, Prabhakar

            According to the research I conducted, I understood that today's
            search engines are very complicated and developed at a super high
            level, they have dozens of different technologies that allow them to
            perform a very fast and accurate search. This level of search
            engines is too high a level for a single programmer like me to work
            on an educational program. I wanted to find the right level for me,
            so that I can also learn new things, but in addition I can finish
            developing the system on time and without quitting in the middle due
            to desperation. To that end, I went to research the basics of search
            engines, how they were first built, to ease the process of building
            the software.
